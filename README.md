Project Overview
This project uses a Raspberry Pi to create a smart kitchen assistant with the following features:

Barcode Scanning: Scan grocery items to add them to the inventory.

Inventory Management: Track items, expiry dates, and quantities.

Recipe Suggestions: Suggest recipes based on available ingredients.

Web Interface: Access the system via a web browser.

Hardware Requirements
Raspberry Pi 4 (or compatible model)

Barcode Scanner (USB or HID device)

RFID Reader (MFRC522 module, optional)

Camera Module (optional for image recognition)

Power Supply (5V, 3A for Pi 4)

MicroSD Card (16GB or larger)

Ethernet Cable/WiFi Dongle (for network connectivity)

Software Setup
1. Install Raspberry Pi OS
Download Raspberry Pi Imager.

Flash the latest Raspberry Pi OS (64-bit) to your microSD card.

Enable SSH and WiFi during setup.

2. Install Dependencies
bash
Copy
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3 python3-pip sqlite3 git
3. Set Up Virtual Environment
bash
Copy
python3 -m venv kitchen_env
source kitchen_env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Enable SPI (for RFID)
bash
Copy
sudo raspi-config
# â†’ Interface Options â†’ SPI â†’ Enable
sudo reboot
Code Structure
Key Files
main.py: Entry point for the application.

src/: Contains all modules.

barcode/: Barcode scanning logic.

camera/: Camera handling (optional).

database/: SQLite database operations.

rfid/: RFID reading/writing (optional).

web/: Flask-based web interface.

data/kitchen.db: SQLite database for inventory.

templates/: HTML templates for the web interface.

static/: CSS and JavaScript files.

Running the Project
1. Start the Application
bash
Copy
python3 main.py
2. Access the Web Interface
Open a browser and navigate to:

Copy
http://[RASPBERRY_PI_IP]:5000
Example: http://192.168.1.20:5000

Frontend Access
1. Direct LAN Access
Connect your laptop and Raspberry Pi to the same network.

Use the Pi's IP address to access the web interface.

2. SSH Port Forwarding
bash
Copy
ssh -L 5000:localhost:5000 pi@[RASPBERRY_PI_IP]
Access http://localhost:5000 on your laptop.

GitHub Repository Setup
1. Create a New Repository
Go to GitHub and log in.

Click New Repository.

Name it (e.g., smart-kitchen-assistant).

Choose Public or Private.

Click Create Repository.

2. Push Your Code
bash
Copy
# Initialize Git
git init

# Add files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Link to GitHub
git remote add origin https://github.com/[YOUR_USERNAME]/smart-kitchen-assistant.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
Future Updates
Expiry Tracking: Add notifications for expiring items.

Recipe Integration: Fetch recipes from external APIs.

Camera Integration: Use the camera for item recognition.

Mobile App: Create a companion app for remote access.

Troubleshooting
1. Barcode Scanner Not Working
Check device permissions:

bash
Copy
ls -l /dev/input/event0
Ensure the scanner is in HID mode.

2. Web Interface Not Accessible
Verify Flask is running:

bash
Copy
sudo netstat -tuln | grep 5000
Check firewall settings:

bash
Copy
sudo ufw allow 5000
